# Good to have unicode characters

A Xmodmap configuration file that maps useful extended unicode characters to `alt` and `alt+shift` modifiers of easily recognizable letters and symbols.

## The mappings
 - The greek delta characters are mapped to `d` so that `alt+d` produces δ and `alt+shift+d` produces Δ
 - The trademark symbol ™ is similarly mapped to `t`
 - The infinity symbol ∞ and interrobang ‽ is mapped to `i`
 - Two different kinds of hearts ❤ ♥ are mapped to `h`
 - The hammer and sickle ☭ is mapped to `alt+shift+c` because `alt+c` is mapped to right arrow → by default on my keyboard
 - Horizontal ellipsis … is mapped to `alt+shift+period`
